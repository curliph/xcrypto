# Crypto Co-processor

This project looks to build a cryptographic accelerator, in a similar style to a
floating-point co-processor.

## Getting Started

Setup the project workspace first:

```sh
$> git clone git@github.com:scarv/hw-crypto-cop.git
$> cd hw-crypto-cop
$> source ./bin/source.me.sh
```

Build the documentation by running `make docs`
