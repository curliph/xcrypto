\subsection{Guarantees}
\label{sec:bg:guarantee}

\begin{itemize}

% TODO: undef. behaviour
\item A raft of challenges stemming from partially defined behaviour in the
      C programming language, and associated compilers, is well documented
      (see, e.g.,~\cite[Section 2.1]{SCARV:SimChiAnd:18}).
      These are particularly problematic wrt. high-assurance software, when


      In order to offer the greatest possible control over and transparency
      wrt. behavioural properties, \XCID includes no undefined or implementation defined.

% TODO: constant time latency
\item The assumption of a shared memory interface, plus the lack of control
      over components beyond that interface (e.g., lower-level caches)

      However, the specification of \XCID commits to a guarantees where all
      instructions 

      have constant-time execution latency; the constant may differ between
      implementations, but will be constant none the less.
