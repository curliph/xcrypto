\subsection{\XCID exceptions}
\label{sec:spec:exceptions}

% =============================================================================

Any instruction-specific exception behaviour is captured by the associated
semantics in \REFSEC{sec:spec:instruction}, with general cases captured in
the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Any attempt to execute an
      invalid \XCID instruction
      will cause an 
      illegal instruction exception.
\item Any attempt to execute a
        valid \XCID instruction
      from a priviledge mode which does not have access to the ISE
      (per fields in $\SPR{XCCR}$)
      will cause an
      illegal instruction exception.
\item Any attempt to execute a
        valid \XCID instruction
      from an unsupported feature class 
      (per fields in $\SPR{XCSR}$) 
      will cause an 
      illegal instruction exception.
\item Any access to the 
      $\SPR{XCSR}$ or $\SPR{XCCR}$
      CSRs from a priviledge mode other than machine mode
      will cause an 
      illegal instruction exception.
\item Any instruction that accesses memory mirrors RV32I wrt. exception,
      synchronisation, and atomicity semantics: for example, if
      a) the effective address stemming from a memory access instruction
         is not aligned to the associated data type, 
         {\em  and}
      b) the implementation does not support misaligned accesses,
         {\em then}
         it will cause a 
         load/store address misaligned exception.
\end{itemize}
