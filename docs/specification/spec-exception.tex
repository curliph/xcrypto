%\item attempted execution of any instruction from an unsupported feature 
%      class will cause an 
%      illegal instruction exception,
%      and
%\item any instruction that accesses memory mirrors RV32I wrt. exception,
%      synchronisation, and atomicity semantics: for example, if
%      a) the effective address stemming from a memory access instruction
%         is not aligned to the associated data type, 
%         {\em  and}
%      b) the implementation does not support misaligned accesses,
%         {\em then}
%         it will cause a 
%         load/store address misaligned exception.

%If a Crypto ISE instruction is encountered in a priviledge mode which
%does not have access to the ISE, then an {\em illegal instruction exception}
%is raised.
%
%Any access to the {\tt mccr} in anything other than machine mode
%causes an {\em illegal instruction exception}.
