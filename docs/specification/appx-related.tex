% bit-slicing

As introduced by Biham~\cite{SCARV:Biham:97}, bit-slicing is based on
a) a non-standard {\em representation} of data,
   and
b) a non-standard {\em implementation} of functions, which operate on
   said representations:
it essentially describes a given cryptographic primitive as a  ``software 
circuit'' comprising a sequence of bit-wise instructions (e.g., NOT, AND, 
and OR).  Although not a general-purpose technique, when applicable, use
of bit-slicing can offer advantages that include constant-time execution 
and hence immunity from cache-based side-channel attacks
(see, e.g.,~\cite{SCARV:KasSch:09}).
In the design of Serpent~\cite[Page 232]{SCARV:BihAndKnu:98}, there is a
suggestion for accelerating bit-sliced implementations via a ``BITSLICE 
instruction'' or ISE; the suggestion was later investigated in detail by 
Grabher et al.~\cite{SCARV:GraGroPag:08}.  In both cases, the idea is to 
``compress'' a sub-circuit, i.e., the sequence of bit-wise instructions 
representing an $n$-input Boolean function, into a Look-Up Table (LUT): 
the LUT is first configured with a truth table for the function, and then 
accessed to apply said function.
