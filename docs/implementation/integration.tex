This section details an example integration of the \COP with
the open source PicoRV32 RISC-V core.

The example integration consists of a single PicoRV32 and \COP
connected via the Pico Co-Processor Interface (PCPI).

The PCPI is a feature of the PicoRV32.
We include the glue logic required in order to interface with the \COP.

The resulting sub-system has two memory ports, one for the \COP and one
for the PicoRV32.
Both memory ports are configured as AXI4-Lite interfaces.

\subsection{Sub-System Overview}

Figure \ref{fig:integration-block} shows the main ports and connections in
the example integration.

The PicoRV32 memory, trace and interrupt interfaces are all exposed, along
with the \COP memory interface.

The top level module for the sub-system is {\tt scarv\_prv\_xcrypt\_top}.
