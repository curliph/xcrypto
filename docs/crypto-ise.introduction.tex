The aim of this project is to
extend the RISC-V architecture in order to accelerate common cryptographic
operations associated with block ciphers.
It proposes a new Instruction Set Extension (ISE)
which acts analogously to a floating-point co-processor,
but targeted at cryptographic operations.
The aim is for the ISE to be applicable to a wide range of algorithms
which work on different bit-widths and with different block sizes.

The key pieces of functionality the ISE aims to provide are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Flexible {\em packed arithmetic}, where multiple values of varying
    lengths can be operated on inside a register in parallel.
\item Byte level access to the general purpose register file for certain
    instructions. Principally loads, stores and arithmetic.
\item Memory Scatter/Gather functionality for bytes.
\item Multi-precision integer arithmetic.
\end{itemize}
