The aim of this project is to
extend the RISC-V architecture in order to accelerate common cryptographic
operations associated with block ciphers.
It proposes a new Instruction Set Extension (ISE)
which acts analogously to a floating-point co-processor,
but targeted at cryptographic operations.
The aim is for the ISE to be applicable to a wide range of algorithms
which work on different bit-widths and with different block sizes.
